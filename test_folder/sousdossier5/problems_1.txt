Most importants are : 

1- Write a php function to convert a json to an array, consider the fact that one or more values in the json can also be the json. So your function should take that in consideration and transform everything , at the end, we should have valid array , and all json should be transformed to array. 
Your input json is a string, look example to better understand

---- Example 1, if i have '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';
i expected:
Array
(
    [name] => John
    [age] => 30
    [city] => New York
)


Example 3, if i have '{"fruits": ["apple", "orange", "banana"], "numbers": [1, 2, 3]}';

i expected :
Array
(
    [fruits] => Array
        (
            [0] => apple
            [1] => orange
            [2] => banana
        )

    [numbers] => Array
        (
            [0] => 1
            [1] => 2
            [2] => 3
        )
)


Example 2: JSON with nested objects and arrays
$json2 = '{"user": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, "languages": ["PHP", "JavaScript", "Python"]}';

i expected:
Array
(
    [user] => Array
        (
            [name] => Alice
            [age] => 25
        )

    [languages] => Array
        (
            [0] => PHP
            [1] => JavaScript
            [2] => Python
        )

)



and :

2- Write a php function that is going to move files in a main folder , to subfolder.
For example, if i am in a folder "main", and i have 15 files

i should be able to call the function and pass a parameter which is the number of maximum files .
So at the end, if i call
---- function(3); i expected to have 5 folders which will be folder1, folder2 ... folder5; 
each of them is going to have maximum of 3 files

---- function(4); i expected to have 4 folders, the latest one is going to have only 3 files 

NB: if a folder already has files, you should count it; so for example if the folder "folder1" already has 2 files, 
you should just complete it to reach the maximum, and continue to generate and move to the next folder
